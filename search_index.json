Introduction","keywords":"","body":"What is Cloudspin?\n\n\n\nCloudspin is a collection of code I (Kief Morris) am using on to explore ways to structure and manage infrastructure as code projects. I am using it to help illustrate concepts, patterns, and practices from my book, Infrastructure as Code, articles, and workshops. I am also using it with client teams I work with at ThoughtWorks to work out ideas for project structures and tooling.\n\n\nI’d like to see this evolve into a community-driven set of tools and template projects (replacing \"I\" with \"we\" in this documentation!) For the moment, I’m making fairly radical changes on an unpredictable basis (in flurries of activity), so it’s likely to be inconsistent and even broken at times.\n\n\nFeel free to copy and use material from here (subject to the terms of the MIT license), but you will need to modify and extend it to make it useful for your own project.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Cloudspinners repositories on Github have the source code of the cloudspin tools, example projects, and this reference documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Cloudspin?\n\n\nCurrently, most people and teams managing infrastructure with tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, etc. define their own unique project structures, and write their own unique wrapper scripts (using make, shell, rake, or whatever) to run that tool and associated tasks. Essentially, each project is a special snowflake.\n\n\nThe goal for cloudspin is to evolve a common structure and build tooling for infrastructure projects, focused on the lifecycle of \"http://infrastructure-as-code.com/patterns/2018/03/28/defining-stacks.html[stacks]\" - groups of infrastructure elements provisioned on dynamic infrastructure such as IaaS clouds.\n\n\nThe hypothesis is that, with a common project structure and tooling, teams can:\n\n\n\n\nSpend less time creating and maintaining scaffolding, and more time on higher value work,\n\n\nBring new team members up to speed more quickly,\n\n\nRapidly create new infrastructure projects, and add new infrastructure to existing projects,\n\n\nMore easily debug and improve infrastructure,\n\n\nAdopt mature engineering practices such as TDD and CD for their infrastructure,\n\n\nHave more fully featured infrastructure sooner in a project.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, common conventions and structures for infrastructure projects can foster an ecosystem:\n\n\n\n\nPeople can create and share tools and scripts that work with the common structure, creating an ecosystem,\n\n\nPeople can then create and share infrastructure code for running various software and services, creating a community library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\n\n\nConvention over configuration. — The tool should discover elements of the project based on folder structure — A given configuration value should be set in a single place — Implies a highly \"https://medium.com/@stueccles/the-rise-of-opinionated-software-ca1ba0140d5b[opinionated]\" approach\n\n\nEncourage good agile engineering practices for the infrastructure code — Writing and running tests should be a natural thing — Building and using infrastructure pipelines should be a natural thing — Secure by default\n\n\nSupport evolutionary architecture — Loose coupling of infrastructure elements\n\n\nEmpower developers / users of infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in Cloudspin\n\n\nAt the moment, cloudspin includes:\n\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin-stack Ruby library, which provides classes for interacting with stack definitions (source code) and instances. This is currently implemented for Terraform projects, for AWS. Other cloud providers should be easy enough to implement. In theory it can be adapted to use tools other than Terraform (e.g. CloudFormation), but in practice it’ll probably need a fair bit of work.\n\n\nSome conventions for structuring project folders for infrastructure stacks, for configuring and provisioning infrastructure stack instances, for packaging infrastructure (Terraform) code into an artefact, and using it in a delivery pipeline (currently with AWS CodePipeline).\n\n\nA command-line tool (included in the cloudspin-stack gem), and some rake tasks which can used to manage stack instances using the cloudspin-stack classes, following the conventions described here.\n\n\nAn example stack project, spin-stack-network, using these conventions and tools.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’d like to add over time, with the help of a community:\n- Conventions and tools for configuring stack instances from different sources (files in the project, key/value stores)\n- Conventions and tools for integrating multiple stacks\n- Conventions and tools for organizing and managing collections of stacks in environments\n- More example projects\n- Develop a library of template stack projects that people can share and use\n- Provide examples and templates for common core services - CI and CD tools, monitoring, log aggregation, etc.\n- Add support and examples for more cloud providers\n- Consider how to support additional infrastructure tools beyond Terraform\n\n\n\n\nThis documentation\n\n\nThe purpose of this reference guide is to explain the conventions the cloudspin code are meant to support, and how to use them. It’s quite likely to lag the actual code, so fair warning.\n\n\n"},"00-starting/":{"url":"00-starting/","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Cloudspin Tutorial 00: Getting started\n\nThis tutorial is about getting the basic tools and whatnot working so you can do the other tutorials.

An infrastructure stack is a collection of infrastructure elements defined and changed as a unit. Stacks are typically managed by tools such as Hashicorp Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager Templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager Templates and OpenStack Heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation uses the term \"stack\", but it maps to other tools as well. When using Terraform, which I tend to use for code examples, a stack correlates to a Terraform project, and a statefile.\n\n\n\n\nStack definitions\n\n\nA stack definition is the code that declares what a stack should be. It is a Terraform project, CloudFormation template, and so on. A stack definition may use shared infrastructure code - for example, CloudFormation nested stacks or Terraform modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack instances\n\n\nA stack definition can be used to provision, and update, one or more stack instances. There are two typical use cases for this.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne use case is for multiple environments. If you have a stack called \"my-service-stack\", you can create an instance of your stack in DEV, another in QA, another in PROD, etc. Because you use the same stack definition for each of these, you know they are consistent in each environment. This is explained in more detail in creating multiple stack instances.\n\n\nAnother use case for re-using a stack definition for multiple roles. For example, if you have a general purpose stack that defines the infrastructure for a service, you might use it for \"serviceA-stack\" and \"serviceB-stack\". A given environment might have stack instances for each of these roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNicki Watt has a great talk on Evolving Your Infrastructure with Terraform which very clearly explains the benefits of using a stack definition for multiple instances, although she doesn’t use exactly the same terminology that I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on state\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the pain points of using Terraform is dealing with statefiles. All stack management tools, including CloudFormation, etc., maintain data structures that reflect which infrastructure elements belong to a given stack instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudFormation and similar tools provided by cloud platform vendors have the advantage of being able to manage instance state transparently - they keep these data structures on their servers. Terraform and other third party tools need to do this themselves.\n\n\nArguably, the explicit state management of Terraform gives you more control and transparency. When your CloudFormation stack gets wedged, you can’t examine the state data structures to see what’s happening. And you (and third parties) have the option of writing tools that use the state data for various purposes. But it does require you to put a bit more work into keeping track of statefiles and making sure they’re available when running the stack management tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"00-starting/setup-workstation.html":{"url":"00-starting/setup-workstation.html","title":"Set up your local tools","keywords":"","body":"Setting up your local development environment\n\n\n\nI develop and test this stuff using a Mac, so my examples tend to be based on this.

The example code can help you do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you use an AWS account dedicated for your learning, not an account that contains any infrastructure that you or anyone else cares about. It is quite simple to create a new AWS account, and generally free or very cheap if you don’t use much resources.\n\n\nWe recommend this because it is good hygiene when working with tutorials, example code, etc., to avoid accidental damage or even key leakage.\n\n\nWe try to be fairly responsible with the CloudSpin code. For example, you should never need to put your AWS credentials anywhere other than the standard ~/.aws folder, which should prevent them from being accidentally committed to a source repository.\n\n\nBut accidents happen, so using a clean account limits the potential harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several steps involved in setting everything up:\n\n\n\n\nCreate and configure your bootstrap credentials, to be able to run the code to set things up. This is described in this page.\n\n\nUse a cloudspin stack to create an S3 bucket to manage Terraform state for the following steps.

This is a basic building block for secure access management for an AWS account. But in order to run the code that sets up these IAM roles, you need to use API credentials which have broader permissions.\n\n\nSo the first thing you need to do is set up a \"bootstrap\" account with API credentials.\n\n\nUsing the AWS web console, create a user (for example, spin_bootstrap) which has the privileges to manage the IAM roles and policies. This will normally be a one-off user; once the stack has been applied to an AWS account, anyone working with the infrastructure, including making IAM changes, should be able to do it using an unprivileged IAM user, and then assume roles with the relevant privileges.\n\n\nCreate the user, then add it to the Power Users managed group, and attach the IAMFullAccess policy to the user. (TODO: we can probably limit this much further, may not need much more than a subset of IAM permissions). Generate an API access key for the user. The user should not need a console password.\n\n\n\n\n(1.2) Add the bootstrap access key to your credentials file\n\n\nPut the access credentials for the bootstrap user into your [AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html).

This preserves the state in the event that anything happens to your local files (e.g. accidentally deleting local statefiles). It also allows multiple people to work on the same infrastructure instances.\n\n\n\n\nState for your statebucket\n\n\nWhere does the statefile for the stack that manages your statefile bucket live? At the moment, this code manages the state for this locally.\n\n\n\n\nPlanning and creating your statebucket\n\n\nThe folder 00-statebucket has a cloudspin project that will create a statebucket for you. This uses the s3bucket stack definition. Here’s how to do it.\n\n\n(1) Create a local configuration file\n\nCreate a file 00-statebucket/stack-statebucket-local.yaml (you can copy 00-statebucket/stack-statebucket-local-example.yaml as a starter), and edit it:\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  group: YOURNAME_sandbox\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n\n\n\nYOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE will be the name of the profile in ~/.aws/credentials with the bootstrap AWS API keys you created if you followed the steps in the previous page.\n\n\nThe group setting doesn’t matter too much. It’s essentially an ID for your environment, which, in more complex setups, can be used to integrate different things together. It is also used in tags.\n\n\n\n(2) Initialize the local project tooling\n\nIn your 00-statebucket folder, run:\n\n\n\nbundle install\n\n\n\nThis installs some Ruby gems that include the cloudspin tools we use in these examples.

You’ll need the name of the bucket to put into configuration for further examples. The name should be something like: statebucket-cloudspin-examples-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where the number at the end is your AWS account ID (which is needed to make sure the bucket name is globally unique).\n\n\n\nDid you do all that?\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you’ve simply followed all of these instructions without having a close look at the code they apply to your cloud account, you have potentially put yourself at risk. This project code could easily have been created by someone unscrupulous. Even if you trust me and know this is my project, someone else could have compromised my project code, and inserted code to exploit your AWS account.\n\n\nYou should make it a habit to carefully vet code before you download and apply it.\n\n\nIn this case, the Ruby gems will have been downloaded into your local Ruby library folder, and the Terraform code will have been downloaded to ./00-statebucket/.cloudspin. I’d encourage you to review this code and make sure you’re comfortable with what it does before running it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat next?\n\n\nNow you can proceed to setting up IAM roles to use your AWS account a bit more securely.\n\n\n"},"00-starting/setup-iam-roles.html":{"url":"00-starting/setup-iam-roles.html","title":"Set up IAM roles","keywords":"","body":"Set up IAM roles\n\n\n\nIn this part, you’ll use the bootstrap user credentials created earlier to create some IAM roles that can be used for further examples.

You will then apply a stack (provided for you, but of course you’ll look over the code before applying it) which will create IAM roles, and give your unprivileged user the right to assume those roles.\n\n\nThis is all done in the name of good security hygiene.

It isn’t particularly useful on its own, since it has no gateways (internet gateway for inbound access, or NAT gateway for outbound), and doesn’t even have routes for traffic within the VPC. But it’s a start.\n\n\n\n\nThe stack definition source\n\n\nThe ./src subfolder of the project contains the Terraform files which are used to create instances of the stack.\n\n\nThis is a standard Terraform project, you could run the terraform command in it, assuming you provide the required variable, and that you have valid aws credentials as the default profile in ~/.aws/credentials, or in the relevant evironment variables:\n\n\n\ncd src\nterraform init\nterraform plan -var instance_identifier=basic-01-manual\n\n\n\nThe output should include (among lots of other output) something like:\n\n\n\nAn execution plan has been generated and is shown below.\nResource actions are indicated with the following symbols:\n  + create\n\nTerraform will perform the following actions:\n\n...  ...\n\nPlan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.\n\n\n\nCloudstack provides some tooling to run Terraform. For this example, there’s no obvious value, but when you start doing more complicated things, this becomes handier. So let’s start using it even for this simple stack, to build an understanding of how it works.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the command line tool\n\n\nThe stack command-line tool, included in the cloudspin-stack gem, can be used to manage stack instances from a stack definition. The main benefit it adds over using the terraform command directly is that it follows certain conventions for finding and passing parameters to an instance, that will make it easier to manage multiple instances from a single stack definition in a consistent way. It also follows conventions for files are organized in the project.\n\n\nFor the example stack, change back into the base folder of the example code (cd .. if you ran the commands above), and run the up command with the --dry option to see the terraform command that will be run:\n\n\n\nstack up --dry\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to:\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\ncd ./work && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'instance_identifier=basic-stack-01' -state=/Users/you/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/01-basic-stack/state/stack-basic-stack-01.tfstate\n\n\n\nHere you can see that, rather than running the project within the ./src folder, the stack tool copies the source code to another folder, and also stores the local state in a folder it creates. This helps later when creating multiple instances, so that each instance has its own copy of relevant files, rather than stepping on one another and potentially losing state.\n\n\nYou can run the terraform plan command by passing the --plan parameter to the up command:\n\n\n\nstack up --plan\n\n\n\nThe output for this should be similar to when you ran terraform earlier.\n\n\nTo destroy the stack, run stack down. You can optionally pass --dry to see the terraform command that will be run, and/or --plan, to see the changes that will be made to destroy the stack.\n\n\n\nstack down\n\n\n\nSummary of the command line\n\nThe basic commands, as seen in the examples above, are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstack up\nCreate or modify the stack instance, using the terraform source found in ./src\n\n\nstack down\nDestroy the stack instance\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these commands take the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--dry\nPrint the terraform command line that will be run, but don’t actually run it\n\n\n--plan\nRun the terraform plan command\n\n\n\n\nThe stack command line tool reference has detailed information on the tool, and the cloudspin stack project reference has more information on the project structure and configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Rakefile\n\n\nA Rakefile allows you to incorporate more actions and logic into managing your stack and related things.\n\n\nBasic rake tasks\n\nTo use the cloudspin rake tasks, you’ll need to add a Gemfile and Rakefile to your project. The Gemfile should add the cloudspin-stack-rake gem:\n\n\n\ngem 'cloudspin-stack-rake'\n\n\n\nRun bundle install to actually install the gem, and its dependencies, into your project. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, which you can add to your project in source control so that consistent versions of the gems are used wherever the project is checked out and run.\n\n\nThe Rakefile has the logic of the builds. The basic elements for using cloudspin are:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nThis names the stack instance that will be created test-network. When you list the available rake tasks from the command line you see what cloudspin has added:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down  # Destroy stack test-network\nrake dry   # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake plan  # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake up    # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\nYou can see these are variations of the command line tool commands seen above. You have up and down to create/update and destroy the stack instance. The dry and plan tasks are applied to the up command.\n\n\n\nAdding a clean task\n\nThe benefit of using rake is you can add more capabilities. You can easily import the capability for rake to clean up working directories for you:\n\n\n\nrequire 'rake/clean'\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCLEAN.include('work')\nCLOBBER.include('state')\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nWith this, running rake clean will remove the work directory, which contains the working files used for the instance. rake clobber takes the more drastic step of also deleting the state directory, which deletes the local statefile. You should only run this after successfully running rake down, otherwise your stack instance will remain in the cloud, and you will no longer be able to use cloudspin (or terraform) to manage it.\n\n\n\n"},"01-basic-stack/stack-testing.html":{"url":"01-basic-stack/stack-testing.html","title":"Testing the simple stack","keywords":"","body":"Testing the simple stack\n\n\n\nCurrently, the cloudspin rake library provides support for running Inspec controls (tests) against AWS infrastructure.\n\n\nThe following is based on the basic-stack example project.\n\n\n\n\nAdding the inspec tasks to the Rakefile\n\n\nYou need to declare a Cloudspin::Stack::Rake::InspecTask object in the rakefile, passing it a StackInstance object for the stack instance to test.\n\n\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nstack = StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nInspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n\n\n\nThis looks for the folder ./test/inspec, and if found, adds the inspec task:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down     # Destroy stack test-network\nrake dry      # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake inspec   # Run inspec tests\nrake plan     # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake up       # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning the inspec tests\n\n\nIn the example project, this simply checks that the VPC with the expected name exists.\n\n\n\n$ rake inspec\nmkdir -p ./work/inspec\nRun inspec\ninspec exec ./test/inspec/. --attrs ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-test-network.yml --reporter json-rspec:./work/inspec/results-for-stack-test-network-profile-infrastructure.json cli -t aws://eu-west-1/assume-spin_stack_manager-skeleton\n\nProfile: Controls for AWS resources (infrastructure)\nVersion: 0.1.0\nTarget:  aws://eu-west-1\n\n  VPCs\n     ✔  name should include \"vpc-test-network\"\n\nTest Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting inspec tests\n\n\nSee the inspec documentation for details on organizing and writing Inspec controls.

This is purely a convention - nothing in cloudspin itself insists on this.\n\n\ninstance:group is used by the cloudspin tools to build unique a instance_identifier for each stack instance. Before, the instance_identifier was set to STACK_NAME, which was taken from the stack:name options set in the stack definition file ./src/stack-definition.yaml. Now, instance:group is added to it, so the the instance_identifier is set to STACK_NAME-INSTANCE_GROUP.\n\n\nIn this example, the stack name is example2, so if you were to run stack up, it would use instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET.\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\ncd /Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/work/example2-NOT_SET && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'environment_name=NOT_SET' -var 'aws_profile=my-cloudspin-user' -var 'assume_role_profile=assume-my-cloudspin-role' -var 'assume_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-cloudspin-iam-role' -var 'instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET' -state=/Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/state/example2-NOT_SET/stack-example2-NOT_SET.tfstate\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment configuration files\n\n\nIt would be useful to set configuration options for multiple environments. This can be done by creating files in a folder called ./environments, each file being named stack-instance-ENVIRONMENT_NAME.yaml.\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  group: sandbox\nparameters:\n  environment_name: sandbox\n\n\n\nThis example overrides the instance:group value and the environment_name parameter, but you could override other variables as well.\n\n\nTo use this with the stack tool, use the -e flag to pass the ENVIRONMENT_NAME to the tool:\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry -e sandbox\ncd /Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/work/example2-sandbox && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'environment_name=sandbox' -var 'instance_identifier=example2-sandbox' -state=/Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/state/example2-sandbox/stack-example2-sandbox.tfstate\n\n\n\nThe stack tool looks for the environment configuration file based on the name passed to the -e flag.\n\n\n\n\nRakefiles and multiple stack instances\n\n\nYou can create multiple StackTask instances in your rakefile, passing an environment string to each one. Like the stack command line tool, the stack rake task will search for the environment configuration file using this string, and use that to configure the stack instance.\n\n\nThis example iterates over each environment name in an array, creating a namespace for each:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\n['sandbox', 'staging'].each { |environment|\n  namespace \"#{environment}\" do\n    StackTask.new(environment).instance\n  end\n}\n\n\n\nSo the rake tasks are grouped by a namespace for each environment:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake sandbox:down    # Destroy stack example2-sandbox\nrake sandbox:dry     # Show command line to be run for stack example2-sandbox\nrake sandbox:plan    # Plan changes to stack example2-sandbox\nrake sandbox:up      # Create or update stack example2-sandbox\nrake staging:down    # Destroy stack example2-staging\nrake staging:dry     # Show command line to be run for stack example2-staging\nrake staging:plan    # Plan changes to stack example2-staging\nrake staging:up      # Create or update stack example2-staging\n\n\n\n"},"02-environments/stack-parameters.html":{"url":"02-environments/stack-parameters.html","title":"Using parameters for stack instances","keywords":"","body":"Setting configuration parameters for a stack instance\n\nStack parameters are passed as variables to the stack definition code, i.e. as variables to be used in the Terraform code.

For example, parameters are values that are passed to the infrastructure code (i.e. terraform variables) for the instance. Resources are configuration settings which are used to run terraform (and perhaps other tools), but not passed as variables to the terraform code. Examples of resources include AWS credential profiles and roles, and remote state configuration options.\n\n\nInstance configuration options are used by cloudspin, see the reference details below.\n\n\nThese parameters can be provided in different ways, depending on which tooling is used to manage a stack instance.\n\n\n\n\nStack instance configuration files\n\n\nThe stack command line tool, and the default rake tasks, will look for the following yaml configuration files and load configuration from them if found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n./stack-instance-defaults.yaml\n\n\n./stack-instance-local.yaml\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, the -defaults file is committed to source control, and so has values that may be useful to any instance of the stack.\n\n\nThe -local file is not committed to source control, and so is used by developers to set values they want to use when managing stacks locally, typically while working on the stack definition code.\n\n\nAny configuration values found in ./stack-instance-local.yaml will override values defined in ./stack-instance-defaults.yaml.\n\n\nThese yaml files (currently) have three top level groups of configuration: instance, parameters, and resources.
