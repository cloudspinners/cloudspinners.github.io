Introduction","keywords":"","body":"What is Cloudspin?\n\n\n\nCloudspin is a collection of code I (Kief Morris) am using on to explore ways to structure and manage infrastructure as code projects. I am using it to help illustrate concepts, patterns, and practices from my book, Infrastructure as Code, articles, and workshops. I am also using it with client teams I work with at ThoughtWorks to work out ideas for project structures and tooling.\n\n\nThis could potentiallly evolve into a community-driven set of tools and template projects (replacing \"I\" with \"we\" in this documentation!) For the moment, I’m making fairly radical changes on an unpredictable basis, so it’s likely to be inconsistent and even broken at times.\n\n\nFeel free to copy and use material from here (subject to the terms of the MIT license), but you will need to modify and extend it to make it useful for your own project. I am not currently maintaining this as a project that assumes people are using it directly, so there is no attempt to preserve backwards compatibility, provide upgrade paths. In other words, copy and use this stuff at your own risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Cloudspinners repositories on Github have the source code of the cloudspin tools, example projects, and this reference documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Cloudspin?\n\n\nCurrently, most people and teams managing infrastructure with tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, etc. define their own unique project structures, and write their own unique wrapper scripts (using make, shell, rake, or whatever) to run that tool and associated tasks. Essentially, each project is a special snowflake. Some tools (such as Terragrunt), are emerging to create common structures and build tooling for infrastructure.\n\n\nCloudspin uses its own structure and tooling for building projects, in order to support the concepts I’m using it to work out. (As mentioned, these are changing and evolving without any attempt at consistency or support. Their purpose is exploration, not a product.) These are based around the lifecycle of \"http://infrastructure-as-code.com/patterns/2018/03/28/defining-stacks.html[stacks]\" - groups of infrastructure elements provisioned on dynamic infrastructure such as IaaS clouds.\n\n\nOver time, a more stable set of structures and tooling may emerge from this. The hypothesis is that, with a common project structure and tooling, teams can:\n\n\n\n\nSpend less time creating and maintaining scaffolding, and more time on higher value work,\n\n\nBring new team members up to speed more quickly,\n\n\nRapidly create new infrastructure projects, and add new infrastructure to existing projects,\n\n\nMore easily debug and improve infrastructure,\n\n\nAdopt mature engineering practices such as TDD and CD for their infrastructure,\n\n\nHave more fully featured infrastructure sooner in a project.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, common conventions and structures for infrastructure projects can foster an ecosystem:\n\n\n\n\nPeople can create and share tools and scripts that work with the common structure, creating an ecosystem,\n\n\nPeople can then create and share infrastructure code for running various software and services, creating a community library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\n\n\nConvention over configuration. — The tool should discover elements of the project based on folder structure — A given configuration value should be set in a single place — Implies a highly \"https://medium.com/@stueccles/the-rise-of-opinionated-software-ca1ba0140d5b[opinionated]\" approach\n\n\nEncourage good agile engineering practices for the infrastructure code — Writing and running tests should be a natural thing — Building and using infrastructure pipelines should be a natural thing — Secure by default\n\n\nSupport evolutionary architecture — Loose coupling of infrastructure elements\n\n\nEmpower developers / users of infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in Cloudspin\n\n\nAt the moment, cloudspin includes:\n\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin-stack Ruby library, which provides classes for interacting with stack definitions (source code) and instances. This is currently implemented for Terraform projects, for AWS. Other cloud providers should be easy enough to implement. In theory it can be adapted to use tools other than Terraform (e.g. CloudFormation), but in practice it’ll probably need a fair bit of work.\n\n\nSome conventions for structuring project folders for infrastructure stacks, for configuring and provisioning infrastructure stack instances, for packaging infrastructure (Terraform) code into an artefact, and using it in a delivery pipeline (currently with AWS CodePipeline).\n\n\nA command-line tool (included in the cloudspin-stack gem), and some rake tasks which can used to manage stack instances using the cloudspin-stack classes, following the conventions described here.\n\n\nAn example stack project, spin-stack-network, using these conventions and tools.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’d like to add over time, with the help of a community:\n- Conventions and tools for configuring stack instances from different sources (files in the project, key/value stores)\n- Conventions and tools for integrating multiple stacks\n- Conventions and tools for organizing and managing collections of stacks in environments\n- More example projects\n- Develop a library of template stack projects that people can share and use\n- Provide examples and templates for common core services - CI and CD tools, monitoring, log aggregation, etc.\n- Add support and examples for more cloud providers\n- Consider how to support additional infrastructure tools beyond Terraform\n\n\n\n\nThis documentation\n\n\nThe purpose of this reference guide is to explain the conventions the cloudspin code are meant to support, and how to use them.

And then it talks about setting up your local tools, AWS account, and then configuring your AWS account to use cloudspin, which involves applying some existing cloudspin code.\n"},"00-starting/stack-concept.html":{"url":"00-starting/stack-concept.html","title":"Concept: What is a stack?","keywords":"","body":"What is a stack?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBased on a blog post on infrastructure-as-code.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term Infrastructure Stack is something I’ve found useful to explain different patterns for organizing infrastructure code. An infrastructure stack is a collection of infrastructure elements defined and changed as a unit. Stacks are typically managed by tools such as Hashicorp Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager Templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager Templates and OpenStack Heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation uses the term \"stack\", but it maps to other tools as well. When using Terraform, which I tend to use for code examples, a stack correlates to a Terraform project, and a statefile.\n\n\n\n\nStack definitions\n\n\nA stack definition is the code that declares what a stack should be. It is a Terraform project, CloudFormation template, and so on. A stack definition may use shared infrastructure code - for example, CloudFormation nested stacks or Terraform modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack instances\n\n\nA stack definition can be used to provision, and update, one or more stack instances. There are two typical use cases for this.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne use case is for multiple environments. If you have a stack called \"my-service-stack\", you can create an instance of your stack in DEV, another in QA, another in PROD, etc. Because you use the same stack definition for each of these, you know they are consistent in each environment. This is explained in more detail in creating multiple stack instances.\n\n\nAnother use case for re-using a stack definition for multiple roles. For example, if you have a general purpose stack that defines the infrastructure for a service, you might use it for \"serviceA-stack\" and \"serviceB-stack\". A given environment might have stack instances for each of these roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNicki Watt has a great talk on Evolving Your Infrastructure with Terraform which very clearly explains the benefits of using a stack definition for multiple instances, although she doesn’t use exactly the same terminology that I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on state\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the pain points of using Terraform is dealing with statefiles. All stack management tools, including CloudFormation, etc., maintain data structures that reflect which infrastructure elements belong to a given stack instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudFormation and similar tools provided by cloud platform vendors have the advantage of being able to manage instance state transparently - they keep these data structures on their servers. Terraform and other third party tools need to do this themselves.\n\n\nArguably, the explicit state management of Terraform gives you more control and transparency. When your CloudFormation stack gets wedged, you can’t examine the state data structures to see what’s happening. And you (and third parties) have the option of writing tools that use the state data for various purposes. But it does require you to put a bit more work into keeping track of statefiles and making sure they’re available when running the stack management tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"00-starting/setup-workstation.html":{"url":"00-starting/setup-workstation.html","title":"Set up your local tools","keywords":"","body":"Setting up your local development environment\n\n\n\nI develop and test this stuff using a Mac, so my examples tend to be based on this.

The example code can help you do this.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you use an AWS account dedicated for your learning, not an account that contains any infrastructure that you or anyone else cares about. It is quite simple to create a new AWS account, and generally free or very cheap if you don’t use much resources.\n\n\nWe recommend this because it is good hygiene when working with tutorials, example code, etc., to avoid accidental damage or even key leakage.\n\n\nWe try to be fairly responsible with the CloudSpin code. For example, you should never need to put your AWS credentials anywhere other than the standard ~/.aws folder, which should prevent them from being accidentally committed to a source repository.\n\n\nBut accidents happen, so using a clean account limits the potential harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several steps involved in setting everything up:\n\n\n\n\nCreate and configure your bootstrap credentials, to be able to run the code to set things up. This is described in this page.\n\n\nUse a cloudspin stack to create an S3 bucket to manage Terraform state for the following steps. This is described in the next page.\n\n\nUse a cloudspin stack to set up IAM roles to assume, and configure your local environment to use these. This is described in the page after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.1) Create AWS bootstrap user\n\n\nUltimately, you will use an AWS IAM User that only has the permission to assume IAM roles in order to carry out activities. This is a basic building block for secure access management for an AWS account. But in order to run the code that sets up these IAM roles, you need to use API credentials which have broader permissions.\n\n\nSo the first thing you need to do is set up a \"bootstrap\" account with API credentials.\n\n\nUsing the AWS web console, create a user (for example, cloudspin_bootstrap) which has the privileges to manage the IAM roles and policies. This will normally be a one-off user; once the stack has been applied to an AWS account, anyone working with the infrastructure, including making IAM changes, should be able to do it using an unprivileged IAM user, and then assume roles with the relevant privileges.\n\n\n(1.1.1) Create the bootstrap user\n\nGo to the \"IAM\" service, go to \"Users\", and click the \"Add User\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.1.2) Add the bootstrap user to relevant groups\n\nWhen prompted, first add the user to the Power Users managed group by clicking \"Add user to group\", searching for the group, and ticking the box for the group in the results list:\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click \"Attach existing policies directly\" button, do a search for the IAMFullAccess policy, then click the policy and click the button to continue.\n\n\n\n(1.1.3) Get API access keys for the boostrap user\n\n(TODO: we can probably limit this much further, may not need much more than a subset of IAM permissions).\n\n\nIf you selected \"programmatic access\" as in the screenshot for the earlier step, you’ll be given a chance to copy the access credentials. The bootstrap user should not need a console password.\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.2) Add the bootstrap access key to your credentials file\n\n\nPut the access credentials for the bootstrap user into your [AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html). Give it a profile name, such as bootstrap_cloudspin.\n\n\nFile: ~/.aws/credentials:\n\n\n\n[cloudspin_bootstrap]\naws_access_key_id = AKIA........\naws_secret_access_key = xxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.3) Test your bootstrap credentials\n\n\nWhen you run:\n\n\n\naws iam list-users --profile cloudspin_bootstrap\n\n\n\nThe output should be something like:\n\n\n\n{\n  \"Users\": [\n    {\n      \"Path\": \"/\",\n      \"UserName\": \"cloudspin_bootstrap\",\n      \"UserId\": \"AKIA........\",\n      \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:iam::999999999999:user/cloudspin_bootstrap\",\n      \"CreateDate\": \"2018-11-02T15:47:42Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n"},"00-starting/setup-statebucket.html":{"url":"00-starting/setup-statebucket.html","title":"Create a remote state bucket","keywords":"","body":"Create a remote statebucket\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin example code is implemented in Terraform, which uses state files to map the resources it manages to your project code.\n\n\nEach stack instance you create will have its own statefile. There are various places you can store these statefiles, including your local hard drive, and hosted services. For our examples, we will store the state for our stack instances in S3. This preserves the state in the event that anything happens to your local files (e.g. accidentally deleting local statefiles). It also allows multiple people to work on the same stack instances from their own computers.\n\n\nSo a key part of bootstrapping is to create an S3 bucket that we can use to store the statefiles. We will use Terraform to create the S3 bucket, which creates a classic bootstrap situation - where do we store the state for the infrastructure that stores the state? The answer is that we will initially have the state for the S3 bucket on local disk, and then once the bucket is created, we will migrate the statefile into it.\n\n\n\n\nPlanning and creating your statebucket\n\n\nThe folder 00-statebucket has a cloudspin stack that will create a statebucket for you. This uses the s3bucket stack definition. Here’s how to do it.\n\n\n(1) Create a local configuration file\n\nCreate a file 00-statebucket/stack-statebucket-local.yaml (you can copy 00-statebucket/stack-statebucket-local-example.yaml as a starter), and edit it:\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  group: YOURNAME_sandbox\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n\n\n\nYOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE will be the name of the profile in ~/.aws/credentials with the bootstrap AWS API keys you created if you followed the steps in the previous page.\n\n\nThe group setting doesn’t matter too much. It’s essentially an ID for your environment, which, in more complex setups, can be used to integrate different things together. It is also used in tags.\n\n\n\n(2) Initialize the local project tooling\n\nIn your 00-statebucket folder, run:\n\n\n\nbundle install\n\n\n\nThis installs some Ruby gems that include the cloudspin tools we use in these examples. This is essentially a one-off, but when you want to update to newer versions of the tools, you’d run bundle update.\n\n\n\n(3) Plan the bucket creation\n\nNow you can see what changes Terraform will make:\n\n\n\nrake plan\n\n\n\nThis downloads the cloudspin s3 bucket stack definition code, and then runs terraform plan.\n\n\n\n(4) Create the bucket\n\n\nrake up\n\n\n\nNow you should have an S3 bucket that can be used for storing Terraform state. You’ll need the name of the bucket to put into configuration for further examples. The name should be something like: statebucket-cloudspin-examples-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where the number at the end is your AWS account ID (which is needed to make sure the bucket name is globally unique).\n\n\n\n(5) Migrate your state to the bucket\n\nNow you need to migrate your terraform state, which is currently in a local folder (./state/YOURNAME_sandbox), to the S3 bucket. This will allow other people in your team to make changes to the statebucket stack.\n\n\nTo migrate your state, you will need to edit your configuration to specify the S3 bucket as the location for the terraform_backend. When cloudspin runs and finds there is a local statefile, and also a remote backend configured, it will set things up so that terraform will migrate the state to the remote location.\n\n\nSo, edit your file 00-statebucket/stack-statebucket-local.yaml to add a terraform_backend section:\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  group: YOURNAME_sandbox\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n\nterraform_backend:\n  bucket: YOURNAME_sandbox-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  profile: YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n  region: eu-west-1\n  encrypt: true\n\n\n\nYou can then run rake dry to see that there are no obvious errors. Unlike other actions, for migrating state from local to the remote bucket, the plan command will make it happen! This is because the \"plan\" command uses the state, so it carries out changes to backend, although it still won’t try to make changes to the infrastructure in the stack it actually manages.\n\n\nWhen you do run:\n\n\n\nrake plan\n\n\n\nthen you should expect to see the following in the output:\n\n\n\nInitializing the backend...\n\nSuccessfully configured the backend \"s3\"! Terraform will automatically\nuse this backend unless the backend configuration changes.\n\n\n\nThis shows that the bucket will be used for state. At the end, you should also see:\n\n\n\nNo changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.\n\n\n\nIf instead you see that terraform will create all of the infrastructure elements, even though they already exist, then this usually means your state did not get migrated up to the s3 bucket.\n\n\n\n(6) After IAM stack, switch to using the IAM roles\n\nThe next step of this tutorial is to create IAM roles that are used to run terraform more securely. Once those have been created, you can switch this stack to use those roles by editing your stack-instance-local.yaml file for this statebucket stack:\n\n\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_UNPRIVEGED_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n  assume_role_profile: YOUR_ASSUME_DELIVERY_ROLE_PROFILE\n  assume_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-delivery\n\nterraform_backend:\n  bucket: YOURNAME_sandbox-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  profile: YOUR_UNPRIVEGED_CREDENTIALS_PROFILE\n  role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager\n  region: eu-west-1\n  encrypt: true\n\n\n\n\nDid you do all that?\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you’ve simply followed all of these instructions without having a close look at the code they apply to your cloud account, you have potentially put yourself at risk. This project code could easily have been created by someone unscrupulous. Even if you trust me and know this is my project, someone else could have compromised my project code, and inserted code to exploit your AWS account.\n\n\nYou should make it a habit to carefully vet code before you download and apply it.\n\n\nIn this case, the Ruby gems will have been downloaded into your local Ruby library folder, and the Terraform code will have been downloaded to ./00-statebucket/.cloudspin. I’d encourage you to review this code and make sure you’re comfortable with what it does before running it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat next?\n\n\nNow you can proceed to setting up IAM roles to use your AWS account a bit more securely.\n\n\n"},"00-starting/setup-iam-roles.html":{"url":"00-starting/setup-iam-roles.html","title":"Create IAM roles","keywords":"","body":"Set up IAM roles\n\n\n\nIn this part, you’ll use the bootstrap user credentials created earlier to create some IAM roles that can be used for further examples. You’ll do this by creating an unprivileged IAM user, with credentials, that will be used to run the code by assuming IAM roles. You will then apply a stack (provided for you, but of course you’ll look over the code before applying it) which will create IAM roles, and give your unprivileged user the right to assume those roles.\n\n\nThis is all done in the name of good security hygiene. AWS has documentation that explains how assuming a role works.\n\n\n\n\n(1) Create an unprivileged user\n\n\nCreate a user (for example, cloudspin_user) in the IAM console.

But the point of creating the IAM roles is so you can use \"assume role\" rather than using the privileged account.\n\n\nAdd an assume-role profile to the file ~/.aws/config:\n\n\n\n[profile assume-cloudspin_examples-account]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-account\nsource_profile = cloudspin_user (1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the profile for the unprivileged user you added to ~/.aws/credentials earlier on this page.\n\n\n\n\nThen in your local configuration file ./stack-instance-local.yaml, replace the bootstrap profile configuration with the configuration that will assume the newly created IAM role instead:\n\n\n\nterraform_backend:\n  bucket: statebucket-cloudspin-examples-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  profile: YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE (1)\n  role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-account (2)\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE (1)\n  assume_role_profile: assume-cloudspin_examples-account (3)\n  assume_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-account (4)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profile for the unprivileged user you added to ~/.aws/credentials earlier on this page.\n\n\nThe ARN for the profile to assume for write access to the S3 statebucket.\n\n\nThe name of the profile in your ~/.aws/config, as described above, which indicates the role terraform should assume to manage infrastructure.\n\n\nThe ARN for the profile terraform should assume.\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, these examples use a highly privileged role for both of these things. These should be split out - a role that has just enough permissions for the S3 statebucket, and another role that has more specific permissions for this particular project.\n\n\n(3.1) Testing it\n\nWe need a nice spec for this. A rough way to test is to run rake plan, expecting it will show that nothing will be changed.\n\n\n\n"},"01-basic-stack/":{"url":"01-basic-stack/","title":"Tutorial 01 - creating a simple stack","keywords":"","body":"Cloudspin Tutorial 01: Creating a simple stack\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to explore how a stack is created and managed with the cloudspin tooling.

The examples in this tutorial all follow the security Best Practice™ of requiring you to assume a role to carry out privileged actions. The cloudspin tools make this easy for you - read on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudspin provides some tooling to run Terraform. For this example, there’s not much obvious value, but when you start doing more complicated things, this becomes handier. So let’s start using it even for this simple stack, to build an understanding of how it works.\n\n\n\n\nThe STACK command line tool\n\n\nThe stack command-line tool, included in the cloudspin-stack gem, can be used to manage stack instances from a stack definition. The main benefit it adds over using the terraform command directly is that it follows certain conventions for finding and passing parameters to an instance, that will make it easier to manage multiple instances from a single stack definition in a consistent way. It also follows conventions for files are organized in the project.\n\n\nConfiguring your stack instance\n\nThe stack tool reads configuration files to find parameters to pass to the terraform command, including the AWS credentials profiles to use. There are two configuration files it looks at.\n\n\nstack-instance-defaults.yaml is included with the project source from the git repository. As the name says, it sets default configurations. But this isn’t enough, you need to override some of these for your own stack instance. To do this, create the second configuration file, stack-instance-local.yaml. You can copy the provided example file to start from:\n\n\n\n$ cp stack-instance-local-example.yaml stack-instance-local.yaml\n\n\n\nThen edit the file, and replace the example values with your own:\n\n\n\nterraform_backend:\n  bucket: statebucket-cloudspin-examples-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n  profile: YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE\n  assume_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-account\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE\n  assume_role_profile: assume-cloudspin_examples-account\n  assume_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-account\n\n\n\nUse the values from the tutorial setup instructions for these.\n\n\nThe file stack-instance-local.yaml is not committed to git (it is listed in the .gitignore file in the base of the examples repository). This lets you set configuration options that are specific to your own instance, so that you and other members of your team can each have your own configuration without conflicts.\n\n\n\nUsing the command line tool\n\nFor the basic stack, change back into the base folder of the example code (cd .. if you ran the raw terraform command in the example earlier), and run the up command with the --dry option to see the terraform command that will be run:\n\n\n\nstack up --dry\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to:\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\ncd ./work/basic-stack-01 && terraform init -backend=true -backend-config 'region=eu-west-1' -backend-config 'encrypt=true' -backend-config 'bucket=statebucket-cloudspin-examples-084751902934' -backend-config 'profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -backend-config 'role_arn=arn:aws:iam::084751902934:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -backend-config 'key=basic-stack-01.tfstate'\ncd ./work/basic-stack-01 && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'aws_profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -var 'assume_role_profile=assume-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'assume_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::084751902934:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'instance_identifier=basic-stack-01'\n\n\n\nHere you can see that, rather than running the project within the ./src folder, the stack tool copies the source code to another folder, and also stores the local state in a folder it creates. This helps later when creating multiple instances, so that each instance has its own copy of relevant files, rather than stepping on one another and potentially losing state.\n\n\nYou can run the terraform plan command by passing the --plan parameter to the up command:\n\n\n\nstack up --plan\n\n\n\nThe output for this should include (among other stuff):\n\n\n\nPlan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.\n\n\n\nThen you can actually create the stack by running stack up without any arguments:\n\n\n\nstack up\n\n\n\nThe output should end with something like:\n\n\n\nApply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.\n\nOutputs:\n\navailability_zones = eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c\nnumber_of_availability_zones = 3\nprivate_subnet_cidr_blocks = 10.1.3.0/24,10.1.4.0/24,10.1.5.0/24\nprivate_subnet_ids = subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\npublic_subnet_cidr_blocks = 10.1.0.0/24,10.1.1.0/24,10.1.2.0/24\npublic_subnet_ids = subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nvpc_cidr = 10.1.0.0/16\nvpc_id = vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\n\nTo destroy the stack, run stack down. You can optionally pass --dry to see the terraform command that will be run, or --plan, to see the changes that will be made to destroy the stack.\n\n\n\nstack down --dry\n\n\n\n\nstack down --plan\n\n\n\n\nstack down\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the command line\n\nThe basic commands, as seen in the examples above, are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstack up\nCreate or modify the stack instance, using the terraform source found in ./src\n\n\nstack down\nDestroy the stack instance\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these commands take the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--dry\nPrint the terraform command line that will be run, but don’t actually run it\n\n\n--plan\nRun the terraform plan command\n\n\n\n\nThe stack command line tool reference has detailed information on the tool, and the cloudspin stack project reference has more information on the project structure and configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Rakefile\n\n\nA Rakefile allows you to incorporate more actions and logic into managing your stack and related things.\n\n\nBasic rake tasks\n\nTo use the cloudspin rake tasks, you’ll need to add a Gemfile and Rakefile to your project. The Gemfile should add the cloudspin-stack-rake gem:\n\n\n\ngem 'cloudspin-stack-rake'\n\n\n\nRun bundle install to actually install the gem, and its dependencies, into your project. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, which you can add to your project in source control so that consistent versions of the gems are used wherever the project is checked out and run.\n\n\nThe Rakefile has the logic of the builds. The basic elements for using cloudspin are:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new\n\n\n\nThis names the stack instance that will be created test-network. When you list the available rake tasks from the command line you see what cloudspin has added:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down    # Destroy stack instance\nrake dry     # Show command line to be run for stack instance\nrake inspec  # Run inspec tests\nrake plan    # Plan changes to stack instance\nrake up      # Create or update stack instance\n\n\n\nYou can see these are variations of the command line tool commands seen above. You have up and down to create/update and destroy the stack instance. The dry and plan tasks are applied to the up command.\n\n\nIf your project has a subfolder named test - as the examples in this tutorial all should - then there is also an inspec target, which is the topic of the the next page.\n\n\n\nAdding a clean task\n\nA benefit of using rake over the stack tool is you can easily incorporate more capabilities (if you don’t mind writing ruby & rake code). For example, add the capability for rake to clean up working directories for you:\n\n\n\nrequire 'rake/clean'\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCLEAN.include('work')\nCLOBBER.include('state')\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new\n\n\n\nWith this, running rake clean will remove the work directory, which contains the working files used for the instance. rake clobber takes the more drastic step of also deleting the local state directory, which would delete the local statefile if there was one. For the examples in this tutorial clobber won’t have any effect, because they all use remote state.\n\n\n\n"},"01-basic-stack/stack-testing.html":{"url":"01-basic-stack/stack-testing.html","title":"Testing the simple stack","keywords":"","body":"Testing the simple stack\n\n\n\nCurrently, the cloudspin rake library provides support for running Inspec controls (tests) against AWS infrastructure.\n\n\nThe following is based on the basic-stack example project.\n\n\n\n\nAdding the inspec tasks to the Rakefile\n\n\nYou need to declare a Cloudspin::Stack::Rake::InspecTask object in the rakefile, passing it a StackInstance object for the stack instance to test.\n\n\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nstack = StackTask.new.instance\nInspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n\n\n\nThis looks for the folder ./test/inspec, and if found, adds the inspec task:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down     # Destroy stack test-network\nrake dry      # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake inspec   # Run inspec tests\nrake plan     # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake up       # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning the inspec tests\n\n\nIn the example project, this simply checks that the VPC with the expected name exists.\n\n\n\n$ rake inspec\nmkdir -p ./work/inspec\nRun inspec\ninspec exec ./test/inspec/. --attrs ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-test-network.yml --reporter json-rspec:./work/inspec/results-for-stack-test-network-profile-infrastructure.json cli -t aws://eu-west-1/assume-spin_stack_manager-skeleton\n\nProfile: Controls for AWS resources (infrastructure)\nVersion: 0.1.0\nTarget:  aws://eu-west-1\n\n  VPCs\n     ✔  name should include \"vpc-test-network\"\n\nTest Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting inspec tests\n\n\nSee the inspec documentation for details on organizing and writing Inspec controls.

This is purely a convention - nothing in cloudspin itself insists on this.\n\n\ninstance:group is used by the cloudspin tools to build unique a instance_identifier for each stack instance. Before, the instance_identifier was set to STACK_NAME, which was taken from the stack:name options set in the stack definition file ./src/stack-definition.yaml. Now, instance:group is added to it, so the the instance_identifier is set to STACK_NAME-INSTANCE_GROUP.\n\n\nCreate your local stack instance configuration\n\nAs with the previous tutorial, you need to create a local configuration file so the cloudspin tools can access your AWS account. You can copy the example configuration file:\n\n\n\n$ cp stack-instance-local-example.yaml stack-instance-local.yaml\n\n\n\nAnd then edit the file to match your account details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Local\" stack instance\n\n\nYou can use the stack command as in the previous tutorial to manage your own instance of the stack.\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\n\n\n\nThe output should look something like:\n\n\n\ncd /YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/02-environments/work/example2-NOT_SET && terraform init -backend=true -backend-config 'region=eu-west-1' -backend-config 'encrypt=true' -backend-config 'bucket=statebucket-cloudspin-examples-xxxxxxxxxxxx' -backend-config 'profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -backend-config 'role_arn=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -backend-config 'key=example2-NOT_SET.tfstate'\ncd /YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/02-environments/work/example2-NOT_SET && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'environment_name=NOT_SET' -var 'aws_profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -var 'assume_role_profile=assume-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'assume_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET'\n\n\n\nThe interesting bit here is the environment_name variable: environment_name=NOT_SET, and the instance_identifier variable: instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET.\n\n\nThe stack-instance-defaults.yaml file, as shown above, defines both the environment and group parameters to be NOT_SET. In order to have multiple stack instances, we’ll need a way to override these.\n\n\nYou can run stack down to destroy this stack instance.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment configuration files\n\n\nConfiguration options for different environments can be set by creating files in a folder called ./environments, each file being named stack-instance-ENVIRONMENT_NAME.yaml.\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  group: sandbox\n\nparameters:\n  environment_name: sandbox\n\n\n\nThis example overrides the instance:group value and the environment_name parameter, but you could override other variables as well.\n\n\nTo use this with the stack tool, use the -e flag to pass the ENVIRONMENT_NAME to the tool:\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry -e sandbox\n\n\n\nThe stack tool uses the environment string passed to it to find a file named ./environments/stack-instance-ENVIRONMENT.yaml, which in this case is: ./environments/stack-instance-sandbox.yaml. The output is something like:\n\n\n\ncd /YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/02-environments/work/example2-sandbox && terraform init -backend=true -backend-config 'region=eu-west-1' -backend-config 'encrypt=true' -backend-config 'bucket=statebucket-cloudspin-examples-xxxxxxxxxxxx' -backend-config 'profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -backend-config 'role_arn=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -backend-config 'key=example2-sandbox.tfstate'\ncd /YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER/02-environments/work/example2-sandbox && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'environment_name=sandbox' -var 'aws_profile=YOUR_UNPRIVILEGED_PROFILE' -var 'assume_role_profile=assume-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'assume_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/spin_role-cloudspin_examples-manager' -var 'instance_identifier=example2-sandbox'\n\n\n\nSo you can see that the environment_name variable passed to terraform is now environment_name=sandbox, and instance_identifier is now instance_identifier=example2-sandbox.\n\n\n\n\nCreate multiple instances of the stack\n\n\nThere are environment configuration files for two environments, sandbox and staging. You can spin up an instance of each:\n\n\n\nstack up -e sandbox\nstack up -e staging\n\n\n\nYou can then see the VPCs in the AWS console, or by running the aws cli:\n\n\n\naws ec2 describe-vpcs --profile assume-cloudspin_examples-manager --region eu-west-1\n\n\n\n\n\nRakefiles and multiple stack instances\n\n\nYou can create multiple StackTask instances in your rakefile, passing an environment string to each one. Like the stack command line tool, the stack rake task will search for the environment configuration file using this string, and use that to configure the stack instance.\n\n\nThis example iterates over each environment name in an array, creating a namespace for each:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\n['sandbox', 'staging'].each { |environment|\n  namespace \"#{environment}\" do\n    stack = StackTask.new(environment).instance\n    InspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n  end\n}\n\n\n\nSo the rake tasks are grouped by a namespace for each environment:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake sandbox:down    # Destroy stack instance\nrake sandbox:dry     # Show command line to be run for stack instance\nrake sandbox:inspec  # Run inspec tests\nrake sandbox:plan    # Plan changes to stack instance\nrake sandbox:up      # Create or update stack instance\nrake staging:down    # Destroy stack instance\nrake staging:dry     # Show command line to be run for stack instance\nrake staging:inspec  # Run inspec tests\nrake staging:plan    # Plan changes to stack instance\nrake staging:up      # Create or update stack instance\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nThe testing story is pretty much the same. The StackTask class automatically adds inspec tasks for each stack instance, as long as it finds inspec controls in the ./test folder. The inspec control code itself needs to use the instance_identifier attribute to ensure it is testing the correct instance:\n\n\n\ninstance_identifier = attribute('instance_identifier', description: 'Which stack to test')\n\ndescribe aws_vpc_list do\n  its('name') { should include \"vpc-#{instance_identifier}\" }\nend\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning up\n\n\n\nstack down -e sandbox\nstack down -e staging\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing more interesting things\n\n\nThe main thing we’ve accomplished in this tutorial is the ability to create more than one stack instance from a single stack definition. The only difference with each instance is the two variables, instance_identifier and environment_name, which only affect tagging. However, you can see how it would be possible to set other variables differently per environment. This would require adding the variables to the environment configuration files, and then adding the variables within the Terraform code to make use of these.\n\n\n"},"02-environments/stack-parameters.html":{"url":"02-environments/stack-parameters.html","title":"Using parameters for stack instances","keywords":"","body":"Setting configuration parameters for a stack instance\n\nStack parameters are passed as variables to the stack definition code, i.e. as variables to be used in the Terraform code.

For example, parameters are values that are passed to the infrastructure code (i.e. terraform variables) for the instance. Resources are configuration settings which are used to run terraform (and perhaps other tools), but not passed as variables to the terraform code. Examples of resources include AWS credential profiles and roles, and remote state configuration options.\n\n\nInstance configuration options are used by cloudspin, see the reference details below.\n\n\nThese parameters can be provided in different ways, depending on which tooling is used to manage a stack instance.\n\n\n\n\nStack instance configuration files\n\n\nThe stack command line tool, and the default rake tasks, will look for the following yaml configuration files and load configuration from them if found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n./stack-instance-defaults.yaml\n\n\n./stack-instance-local.yaml\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, the -defaults file is committed to source control, and so has values that may be useful to any instance of the stack.\n\n\nThe -local file is not committed to source control, and so is used by developers to set values they want to use when managing stacks locally, typically while working on the stack definition code.\n\n\nAny configuration values found in ./stack-instance-local.yaml will override values defined in ./stack-instance-defaults.yaml.\n\n\nThese yaml files (currently) have three top level groups of configuration: instance, parameters, and resources.

By convention, it will be used to name various files that cloudspin uses, which may include working files, statefiles, configuration registry entries, etc.\n\n\nThe instance_identifier can be set explicitly in various ways, e.g. as a command line parameter to the stack tool, parameters passed to cloudspin-rake tasks, or in a stack instance configuration file:\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  identifier: example1-sandbox\n\n\n\nIf the variable is not explicitly set, cloudspin will generate it, setting it to stack:name-stack:role-instance:group.

Let’s say you have two applications, appA and appB. The service infrastructure stack is pretty much the same for both - application server, database cluster, security groups and load balancer. You want to use the same Terraform code for both. But you want to be able to deploy an instance of both applications in each of your environments - qa, staging, and production. So the stack instances need to have different names.\n\n\nSo you’d end up with:\n\n\n\n\nservice-appA-qa\n\n\nservice-appB-qa\n\n\nservice-appA-staging\n\n\nservice-appB-staging\n\n\nservice-appA-production\n\n\nservice-appB-production\n\n\n\n\nYou may also want to tailor the configuration for each application, without needing to change the Terraform source code. Maybe you pass a variable to install the relevant application code, or set some URL path details.\n"},"reference/stack-command-line.html":{"url":"reference/stack-command-line.html","title":"Stack command line tool","keywords":"","body":"Cloudspin stack command line tool reference\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin stack command line tool is included in the cloudspin-stack gem.

The Gemfile should add the cloudspin-stack-rake gem:\n\n\n\ngem 'cloudspin-stack-rake'\n\n\n\nThis gem has cloudspin-stack as a dependency, so that gem will also be installed by default, along with a few other dependencies. See the source code for cloudspin-stack and cloudspin-stack-rake.\n\n\nRun bundle install to actually install the gems into your project. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, which you can add to your project in source control so that consistent versions of the gems are used wherever the project is checked out and run.\n\n\n\n\nBasic rake tasks for a single stack instance\n\n\nBy creating an instance of the ruby StackTask class in your Rakefile, a set of tasks are created to manage a stack instance.\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nThis assumes that the ./src/stack-definition.yaml exists. It will also look for ./stack-instance-defaults.yaml and ./stack-instance-local.yaml, and use these for parameters to pass to terraform. If the Terraform source code under ./src declares variables without defaults, they will need to be declared in one of these files.\n\n\nSimplifying StackTask declarations\n\nIf you include the module in your rakefile, the code to declare the tasks becomes simpler, which helps if you go beyond the very simple example:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nStackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\nIn the above example, the tasks are created in the root namespace. But as you add more things to your rakefile, namespaces are useful to organize code and tasks. Simply wrap the StackTask declaration in a namespace:\n\n\n\nrequire 'rake/clean'\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCLEAN.include('work')\nCLEAN.include('build')\nCLOBBER.include('state')\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nnamespace :network do\n  StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nend\n\n\n\nThis makes the task list a bit more organized:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake clean          # Remove any temporary products\nrake clobber        # Remove any generated files\nrake network:down   # Destroy stack test-network\nrake network:dry    # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake network:plan   # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake network:up     # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple instances\n\n\n\n\n\nInspec task for testing\n\n\nThe cloudspin-stack-rake library includes a task for running Inspec tests against a stack instance. It assumes the inspec profile(s) are in ./test/inspec.\n\n\nIncluding the inspec task in the rakfile:\n\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nstack = StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nInspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n\n\n\n\nInspec attributes\n\nAll stack instance attributes (as described in the project structure reference guide) defined for the stack instance to be tested are made available as Inspec attributes, so they can be used in tests.\n\n\n\naws_region = attribute('region', description: 'aws region')\ndescribe aws_region do\n  it 'region attribute should be available' do\n    expect(subject).not_to eq('')\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nFiles generated by the inspec task:\n\nAn inspec attribute file is automatically generated in ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-INSTANCE_NAME.yml.\n\n\nThe log output from the inspec run, including stack traces, is generated in ./work/inspec/results-for-stack-INSTANCE_NAME-profile-PROFILE_NAME.json. PROFILE_NAME is set in the inspec profile file (./test/inspec/inspec.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\nArtefact management\n\n\n\n"},"reference/cloudspin-artefacts.html":{"url":"reference/cloudspin-artefacts.html","title":"Cloudspin Artefacts","keywords":"","body":"Reference: Cloudspin Artefacts\n"}}}
