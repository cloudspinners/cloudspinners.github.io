is Cloudspin?\n\n\n\nCloudspin is a collection of code I (Kief Morris) am using on to explore ways to structure and manage infrastructure as code projects. I am using it to help illustrate concepts, patterns, and practices from my book, Infrastructure as Code, articles, and workshops. I am also using it with client teams I work with at ThoughtWorks to work out ideas for project structures and tooling.\n\n\nI’d like to see this evolve into a community-driven set of tools and template projects (replacing \"I\" with \"we\" in this documentation!) For the moment, I’m making fairly radical changes on an unpredictable basis (in flurries of activity), so it’s likely to be inconsistent and even broken at times.\n\n\nFeel free to copy and use material from here (subject to the terms of the MIT license), but you will need to modify and extend it to make it useful for your own project.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Cloudspinners repositories on Github have the source code of the cloudspin tools, example projects, and this reference documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Cloudspin?\n\n\nCurrently, most people and teams managing infrastructure with tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, etc. define their own unique project structures, and write their own unique wrapper scripts (using make, shell, rake, or whatever) to run that tool and associated tasks. Essentially, each project is a special snowflake.\n\n\nThe goal for cloudspin is to evolve a common structure and build tooling for infrastructure projects, focused on the lifecycle of \"http://infrastructure-as-code.com/patterns/2018/03/28/defining-stacks.html[stacks]\" - groups of infrastructure elements provisioned on dynamic infrastructure such as IaaS clouds.\n\n\nThe hypothesis is that, with a common project structure and tooling, teams can:\n\n\n\n\nSpend less time creating and maintaining scaffolding, and more time on higher value work,\n\n\nBring new team members up to speed more quickly,\n\n\nRapidly create new infrastructure projects, and add new infrastructure to existing projects,\n\n\nMore easily debug and improve infrastructure,\n\n\nAdopt mature engineering practices such as TDD and CD for their infrastructure,\n\n\nHave more fully featured infrastructure sooner in a project.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, common conventions and structures for infrastructure projects can foster an ecosystem:\n\n\n\n\nPeople can create and share tools and scripts that work with the common structure, creating an ecosystem,\n\n\nPeople can then create and share infrastructure code for running various software and services, creating a community library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\n\n\nConvention over configuration. — The tool should discover elements of the project based on folder structure — A given configuration value should be set in a single place — Implies a highly \"https://medium.com/@stueccles/the-rise-of-opinionated-software-ca1ba0140d5b[opinionated]\" approach\n\n\nEncourage good agile engineering practices for the infrastructure code — Writing and running tests should be a natural thing — Building and using infrastructure pipelines should be a natural thing — Secure by default\n\n\nSupport evolutionary architecture — Loose coupling of infrastructure elements\n\n\nEmpower developers / users of infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in Cloudspin\n\n\nAt the moment, cloudspin includes:\n\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin-stack Ruby library, which provides classes for interacting with stack definitions (source code) and instances. This is currently implemented for Terraform projects, for AWS. Other cloud providers should be easy enough to implement. In theory it can be adapted to use tools other than Terraform (e.g. CloudFormation), but in practice it’ll probably need a fair bit of work.\n\n\nSome conventions for structuring project folders for infrastructure stacks, for configuring and provisioning infrastructure stack instances, for packaging infrastructure (Terraform) code into an artefact, and using it in a delivery pipeline (currently with AWS CodePipeline).\n\n\nA command-line tool (included in the cloudspin-stack gem), and some rake tasks which can used to manage stack instances using the cloudspin-stack classes, following the conventions described here.\n\n\nAn example stack project, spin-stack-network, using these conventions and tools.\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’d like to add over time, with the help of a community:\n- Conventions and tools for configuring stack instances from different sources (files in the project, key/value stores)\n- Conventions and tools for integrating multiple stacks\n- Conventions and tools for organizing and managing collections of stacks in environments\n- More example projects\n- Develop a library of template stack projects that people can share and use\n- Provide examples and templates for common core services - CI and CD tools, monitoring, log aggregation, etc.\n- Add support and examples for more cloud providers\n- Consider how to support additional infrastructure tools beyond Terraform\n\n\n\n\nThis documentation\n\n\nThe purpose of this reference guide is to explain the conventions the cloudspin code are meant to support, and how to use them. It’s quite likely to lag the actual code, so fair warning.\n\n\n"},"example-project/":{"url":"example-project/","title":"Example project","keywords":"","body":"What is a stack?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBased on a blog post on infrastructure-as-code.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term Infrastructure Stack is something I’ve found useful to explain different patterns for organizing infrastructure code. An infrastructure stack is a collection of infrastructure elements defined and changed as a unit. Stacks are typically managed by tools such as Hashicorp Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager Templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager Templates and OpenStack Heat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation uses the term \"stack\", but it maps to other tools as well. When using Terraform, which I tend to use for code examples, a stack correlates to a Terraform project, and a statefile.\n\n\n\n\nStack definitions\n\n\nA stack definition is the code that declares what a stack should be. It is a Terraform project, CloudFormation template, and so on. A stack definition may use shared infrastructure code - for example, CloudFormation nested stacks or Terraform modules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStack instances\n\n\nA stack definition can be used to provision, and update, one or more stack instances. There are two typical use cases for this.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne use case is for multiple environments. If you have a stack called \"my-service-stack\", you can create an instance of your stack in DEV, another in QA, another in PROD, etc. Because you use the same stack definition for each of these, you know they are consistent in each environment. This is explained in more detail in creating multiple stack instances.\n\n\nAnother use case for re-using a stack definition for multiple roles. For example, if you have a general purpose stack that defines the infrastructure for a service, you might use it for \"serviceA-stack\" and \"serviceB-stack\". A given environment might have stack instances for each of these roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNicki Watt has a great talk on Evolving Your Infrastructure with Terraform which very clearly explains the benefits of using a stack definition for multiple instances, although she doesn’t use exactly the same terminology that I do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on state\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the pain points of using Terraform is dealing with statefiles. All stack management tools, including CloudFormation, etc., maintain data structures that reflect which infrastructure elements belong to a given stack instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloudFormation and similar tools provided by cloud platform vendors have the advantage of being able to manage instance state transparently - they keep these data structures on their servers. Terraform and other third party tools need to do this themselves.\n\n\nArguably, the explicit state management of Terraform gives you more control and transparency. When your CloudFormation stack gets wedged, you can’t examine the state data structures to see what’s happening. And you (and third parties) have the option of writing tools that use the state data for various purposes. But it does require you to put a bit more work into keeping track of statefiles and making sure they’re available when running the stack management tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"example-project/examples-setup.html":{"url":"example-project/examples-setup.html","title":"Prerequisites","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisites\n\nWorkstation\n\n\nI develop and test this stuff using a Mac, so my examples tend to be based on this.

I strongly recommend you don’t use your root account for this, set up an IAM user with more limited role. I recommend you set up an account with very little access other than assume-role, then create an IAM role to assume. (We need instructions for this, at least a link to docs).\n\n\nThe example code is set up to assume an IAM role, to support this way of working.\n\n\nIn your aws credentials file, put the API keys for a user with the right to assume role:\n\n\n~/.aws/credentials\n\n\n\n[my-cloudspin-user]\naws_access_key_id = AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\naws_secret_access_key = blahblahblah\n\n\n\nCreate an IAM role in your AWS account. It should probably be in the Power User group, maybe Administrators for examples later on that do IAM configuration.\n\n\nIn your aws profile config file, create a profile that indicates this IAM role:\n\n\n~/.aws/config\n\n\n\n[profile assume-my-cloudspin-role]\nrole_arn = arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-cloudspin-iam-role\nsource_profile = my-cloudspin-user\n\n\n\nIn the cloudspin code examples, when creating an instance you will normally need to pass the names of these two profiles, typically in a configuration file:\n\n\n~/myproject/stack-instance-local.yaml\n\n\n\nresources:\n  aws_profile: my-cloudspin-user\n  assume_role_profile: assume-my-cloudspin-role\n  assume_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-cloudspin-iam-role\n\n\n\n\nProject setup\n\nSource code\n\n\nSource code on github\n\n\n\n\nSetting up each project\n\n\nFor each cloudspin project, you will typically need to run bundle install before using it, to install Ruby dependencies that are used by the tools.\n\n\nYou may also want to install gem install cloudspin-stack globally, to get the stack command-line tool. (I haven’t found a convenient way to have this usable within a project without needing to run bundle exec stack).\n\n\n"},"example-project/stack-starting.html":{"url":"example-project/stack-starting.html","title":"Creating a simple stack","keywords":"","body":"Creating a simple stack\n\n\n\nThis section examines the basic parts of a cloudspin stack definition project, and the basic lifecycle of a stack instance.\n\n\nSee the setup instructions for what you need to install and configure to be ready to run this example.\n\n\n\n\nThe example source code\n\n\nThis is in the folder examples/01-basic-stack, available from github at https://github.com/cloudspinners/cloudspin-reference/tree/master/part1/examples/01-basic-stack\n\n\nThis stack simply creates a VPC, and private and public subnets. It isn’t particularly useful on its own, since it has no gateways (internet gateway for inbound access, or NAT gateway for outbound), and doesn’t even have routes for traffic within the VPC. But it’s a start.\n\n\n\n\nThe stack definition source\n\n\nThe ./src subfolder of the project contains the Terraform files which are used to create instances of the stack.\n\n\nThis is a standard Terraform project, you could run the terraform command in it, assuming you provide the required variable, and that you have valid aws credentials as the default profile in ~/.aws/credentials, or in the relevant evironment variables:\n\n\n\ncd src\nterraform init\nterraform plan -var instance_identifier=basic-01-manual\n\n\n\nThe output should include (among lots of other output) something like:\n\n\n\nAn execution plan has been generated and is shown below.\nResource actions are indicated with the following symbols:\n  + create\n\nTerraform will perform the following actions:\n\n...  ...\n\nPlan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.\n\n\n\nCloudstack provides some tooling to run Terraform. For this example, there’s no obvious value, but when you start doing more complicated things, this becomes handier. So let’s start using it even for this simple stack, to build an understanding of how it works.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the command line tool\n\n\nThe stack command-line tool, included in the cloudspin-stack gem, can be used to manage stack instances from a stack definition. The main benefit it adds over using the terraform command directly is that it follows certain conventions for finding and passing parameters to an instance, that will make it easier to manage multiple instances from a single stack definition in a consistent way. It also follows conventions for files are organized in the project.\n\n\nFor the example stack, change back into the base folder of the example code (cd .. if you ran the commands above), and run the up command with the --dry option to see the terraform command that will be run:\n\n\n\nstack up --dry\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to:\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\ncd ./work && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'instance_identifier=basic-stack-01' -state=/Users/you/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/01-basic-stack/state/stack-basic-stack-01.tfstate\n\n\n\nHere you can see that, rather than running the project within the ./src folder, the stack tool copies the source code to another folder, and also stores the local state in a folder it creates. This helps later when creating multiple instances, so that each instance has its own copy of relevant files, rather than stepping on one another and potentially losing state.\n\n\nYou can run the terraform plan command by passing the --plan parameter to the up command:\n\n\n\nstack up --plan\n\n\n\nThe output for this should be similar to when you ran terraform earlier.\n\n\nTo destroy the stack, run stack down. You can optionally pass --dry to see the terraform command that will be run, and/or --plan, to see the changes that will be made to destroy the stack.\n\n\n\nstack down\n\n\n\nSummary of the command line\n\nThe basic commands, as seen in the examples above, are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstack up\nCreate or modify the stack instance, using the terraform source found in ./src\n\n\nstack down\nDestroy the stack instance\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these commands take the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--dry\nPrint the terraform command line that will be run, but don’t actually run it\n\n\n--plan\nRun the terraform plan command\n\n\n\n\nThe stack command line tool reference has detailed information on the tool, and the cloudspin stack project reference has more information on the project structure and configuration files.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Rakefile\n\n\nA Rakefile allows you to incorporate more actions and logic into managing your stack and related things.\n\n\nBasic rake tasks\n\nTo use the cloudspin rake tasks, you’ll need to add a Gemfile and Rakefile to your project. The Gemfile should add the cloudspin-stack-rake gem:\n\n\n\ngem 'cloudspin-stack-rake'\n\n\n\nRun bundle install to actually install the gem, and its dependencies, into your project. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, which you can add to your project in source control so that consistent versions of the gems are used wherever the project is checked out and run.\n\n\nThe Rakefile has the logic of the builds. The basic elements for using cloudspin are:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nThis names the stack instance that will be created test-network. When you list the available rake tasks from the command line you see what cloudspin has added:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down  # Destroy stack test-network\nrake dry   # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake plan  # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake up    # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\nYou can see these are variations of the command line tool commands seen above. You have up and down to create/update and destroy the stack instance. The dry and plan tasks are applied to the up command.\n\n\n\nAdding a clean task\n\nThe benefit of using rake is you can add more capabilities. You can easily import the capability for rake to clean up working directories for you:\n\n\n\nrequire 'rake/clean'\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCLEAN.include('work')\nCLOBBER.include('state')\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nWith this, running rake clean will remove the work directory, which contains the working files used for the instance. rake clobber takes the more drastic step of also deleting the state directory, which deletes the local statefile. You should only run this after successfully running rake down, otherwise your stack instance will remain in the cloud, and you will no longer be able to use cloudspin (or terraform) to manage it.\n\n\n\n"},"example-project/stack-testing.html":{"url":"example-project/stack-testing.html","title":"Testing the simple stack","keywords":"","body":"Testing the simple stack\n\n\n\nCurrently, the cloudspin rake library provides support for running Inspec controls (tests) against AWS infrastructure.\n\n\nThe following is based on the basic-stack example project.\n\n\n\n\nAdding the inspec tasks to the Rakefile\n\n\nYou need to declare a Cloudspin::Stack::Rake::InspecTask object in the rakefile, passing it a StackInstance object for the stack instance to test.\n\n\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nstack = StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nInspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n\n\n\nThis looks for the folder ./test/inspec, and if found, adds the inspec task:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake down     # Destroy stack test-network\nrake dry      # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake inspec   # Run inspec tests\nrake plan     # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake up       # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning the inspec tests\n\n\nIn the example project, this simply checks that the VPC with the expected name exists.\n\n\n\n$ rake inspec\nmkdir -p ./work/inspec\nRun inspec\ninspec exec ./test/inspec/. --attrs ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-test-network.yml --reporter json-rspec:./work/inspec/results-for-stack-test-network-profile-infrastructure.json cli -t aws://eu-west-1/assume-spin_stack_manager-skeleton\n\nProfile: Controls for AWS resources (infrastructure)\nVersion: 0.1.0\nTarget:  aws://eu-west-1\n\n  VPCs\n     ✔  name should include \"vpc-test-network\"\n\nTest Summary: 1 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting inspec tests\n\n\nSee the inspec documentation for details on organizing and writing Inspec controls. One bit of support that the cloudspin inspec rake task provides is passing parameters to the inspec controls. By default, all of the stack parameters are made available as attributes within the control.\n\n\nThe example uses the stack_instance_id:\n\n\n\ntitle 'vpc'\n\nstack_instance_id = attribute('stack_instance_id', description: 'Which stack to test')\n\ndescribe aws_vpc_list do\n  its('name') { should include \"vpc-#{stack_instance_id}\" }\nend\n\n\n\nAnother test shows that the region parameter has been set (it’s set in the file stack-instance-defaults.yaml):\n\n\n\naws_region = attribute('region', description: 'aws region')\ndescribe aws_region do\n  it 'region attribute should be available' do\n    expect(subject).not_to eq('')\n  end\nend\n\n\n\nRunning rake inspec in the example project runs these two controls:\n\n\n\n$ rake inspec\nmkdir -p ./work/inspec\nRun inspec\ninspec exec ./test/inspec/. --attrs ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-test-network.yml --reporter json-rspec:./work/inspec/results-for-stack-test-network-profile-infrastructure.json cli -t aws://eu-west-1/assume-spin_stack_manager-skeleton\n\nProfile: Controls for AWS resources (infrastructure)\nVersion: 0.1.0\nTarget:  aws://eu-west-1\n\n  VPCs\n     ✔  name should include \"vpc-test-network\"\n  eu-west-1\n     ✔  region attribute should be available\n\nTest Summary: 2 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere stuff is\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, cloudspin copies the source code to an instance folder, by default ./work.

The log output, useful for debugging failed tests, is put in ./work/inspec/results-for-stack-INSTANCE_NAME-profile-PROFILE_NAME.json.

Now, instance:group is added to it, so the the instance_identifier is set to STACK_NAME-INSTANCE_GROUP.\n\n\nIn this example, the stack name is example2, so if you were to run stack up, it would use instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET.\n\n\n\n$ stack up --dry\ncd /Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/work/example2-NOT_SET && terraform apply -var 'region=eu-west-1' -var 'availability_zones=eu-west-1a,eu-west-1b,eu-west-1c' -var 'environment_name=NOT_SET' -var 'aws_profile=my-cloudspin-user' -var 'assume_role_profile=assume-my-cloudspin-role' -var 'assume_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/my-cloudspin-iam-role' -var 'instance_identifier=example2-NOT_SET' -state=/Users/you/spin/cloudspin-reference/part1/examples/02-multiple-stacks/state/example2-NOT_SET/stack-example2-NOT_SET.tfstate\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment configuration files\n\n\nIt would be useful to set configuration options for multiple environments.

By convention, it will be used to name various files that cloudspin uses, which may include working files, statefiles, configuration registry entries, etc.\n\n\nThe instance_identifier can be set explicitly in various ways, e.g. as a command line parameter to the stack tool, parameters passed to cloudspin-rake tasks, or in a stack instance configuration file:\n\n\n\ninstance:\n  identifier: example1-sandbox\n\n\n\nIf the variable is not explicitly set, cloudspin will generate it, setting it to stack:name-stack:role-instance:group. If either or both of stack:role and instance:group are not set, they will not be included in the name (and neither will the dashes.)\n\n\nSo example values for instance_identifier include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstack:name\nstack:role\ninstance:group\nvalue of instance_identifer\n\n\n\n\nwebserver\nmyapp\nstaging\nwebserver-myapp-staging\n\n\nwebserver\n(not set)\nstaging\nwebserver-staging\n\n\nwebserver\nmyapp\n(not set)\nwebserver-myapp\n\n\nwebserver\n(not set)\n(not set)\nwebserver\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"reference/cloudspin-stack-roles.html":{"url":"reference/cloudspin-stack-roles.html","title":"Cloudspin stack roles","keywords":"","body":"Reference: Cloudspin stack roles\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThis is not yet implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nA stack role is a set of configuration defaults applied on top of a stack definition. The idea is that you can have re-usable code for an infrastructure concept - a webserver, database cluster, etc. - and then have a role that configures it more specifically. Roles are typically related to a particular service or application. You can then create multiple instances of a stack role, for example one in each environment.\n\n\nFor example. Let’s say you have two applications, appA and appB. The service infrastructure stack is pretty much the same for both - application server, database cluster, security groups and load balancer. You want to use the same Terraform code for both. But you want to be able to deploy an instance of both applications in each of your environments - qa, staging, and production. So the stack instances need to have different names.\n\n\nSo you’d end up with:\n\n\n\n\nservice-appA-qa\n\n\nservice-appB-qa\n\n\nservice-appA-staging\n\n\nservice-appB-staging\n\n\nservice-appA-production\n\n\nservice-appB-production\n\n\n\n\nYou may also want to tailor the configuration for each application, without needing to change the Terraform source code. Maybe you pass a variable to install the relevant application code, or set some URL path details.\n"},"reference/stack-command-line.html":{"url":"reference/stack-command-line.html","title":"Stack command line tool","keywords":"","body":"Cloudspin stack command line tool reference\n\n\n\nThe cloudspin stack command line tool is included in the cloudspin-stack gem.

The Gemfile should add the cloudspin-stack-rake gem:\n\n\n\ngem 'cloudspin-stack-rake'\n\n\n\nThis gem has cloudspin-stack as a dependency, so that gem will also be installed by default, along with a few other dependencies. See the source code for cloudspin-stack and cloudspin-stack-rake.\n\n\nRun bundle install to actually install the gems into your project. This will create a Gemfile.lock file, which you can add to your project in source control so that consistent versions of the gems are used wherever the project is checked out and run.\n\n\n\n\nBasic rake tasks for a single stack instance\n\n\nBy creating an instance of the ruby StackTask class in your Rakefile, a set of tasks are created to manage a stack instance.\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCloudspin::Stack::Rake::StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\nThis assumes that the ./src/stack-definition.yaml exists. It will also look for ./stack-instance-defaults.yaml and ./stack-instance-local.yaml, and use these for parameters to pass to terraform. If the Terraform source code under ./src declares variables without defaults, they will need to be declared in one of these files.\n\n\nSimplifying StackTask declarations\n\nIf you include the module in your rakefile, the code to declare the tasks becomes simpler, which helps if you go beyond the very simple example:\n\n\n\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nStackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\nIn the above example, the tasks are created in the root namespace. But as you add more things to your rakefile, namespaces are useful to organize code and tasks. Simply wrap the StackTask declaration in a namespace:\n\n\n\nrequire 'rake/clean'\nrequire 'cloudspin/stack/rake'\n\nCLEAN.include('work')\nCLEAN.include('build')\nCLOBBER.include('state')\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nnamespace :network do\n  StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nend\n\n\n\nThis makes the task list a bit more organized:\n\n\n\n$ rake -T\nrake clean          # Remove any temporary products\nrake clobber        # Remove any generated files\nrake network:down   # Destroy stack test-network\nrake network:dry    # Show command line to be run for stack test-network\nrake network:plan   # Plan changes to stack test-network\nrake network:up     # Create or update stack test-network\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple instances\n\n\n\n\n\nInspec task for testing\n\n\nThe cloudspin-stack-rake library includes a task for running Inspec tests against a stack instance. It assumes the inspec profile(s) are in ./test/inspec.\n\n\nIncluding the inspec task in the rakfile:\n\n\ninclude Cloudspin::Stack::Rake\n\nstack = StackTask.new(id: 'test-network').instance\nInspecTask.new(stack_instance: stack)\n\n\n\n\nInspec attributes\n\nAll stack instance attributes (as described in the project structure reference guide) defined for the stack instance to be tested are made available as Inspec attributes, so they can be used in tests.\n\n\n\naws_region = attribute('region', description: 'aws region')\ndescribe aws_region do\n  it 'region attribute should be available' do\n    expect(subject).not_to eq('')\n  end\nend\n\n\n\n\nFiles generated by the inspec task:\n\nAn inspec attribute file is automatically generated in ./work/inspec/attributes-for-stack-INSTANCE_NAME.yml.\n\n\nThe log output from the inspec run, including stack traces, is generated in ./work/inspec/results-for-stack-INSTANCE_NAME-profile-PROFILE_NAME.json. PROFILE_NAME is set in the inspec profile file (./test/inspec/inspec.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\nArtefact management\n\n\n\n"},"reference/cloudspin-artefacts.html":{"url":"reference/cloudspin-artefacts.html","title":"Cloudspin Artefacts","keywords":"","body":"Reference: Cloudspin Artefacts\n"}}}
